## Study Strategy

1. **Focus on understanding, not memorizing**
2. **Watch NeetCode's explanation even if you solve it**
3. **Revisit problems after a few days**
4. **Document your thought process in code comments**
5. **Track time/space complexity**

## Notes

- Each solution includes problem description, approach, and complexity analysis
- Multiple solutions included when applicable (brute force → optimal)
- Commit message format: `[Category] Problem Name - Status`
  - Example: `[Arrays] Two Sum - Solved`
  - Example: `[DP] Coin Change - Optimized solution`
